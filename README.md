ðŸ¤– AI-Based Recommendation System Using Java & Apache Mahout 

This project demonstrates how to build a simple yet effective recommendation system using Java and Apache Mahout. It suggests relevant products or content to users based on their preferences, following collaborative filtering techniques commonly used in platforms like Amazon and Netflix.

ðŸ“Œ Objective :

The goal of this project is to implement an AI-powered recommendation engine that can analyze user-item interaction data (such as ratings or clicks) and recommend items a user is likely to prefer. The system is built using item-based and user-based collaborative filtering algorithms provided by Apache Mahout.

ðŸ§  Key Features :

  -Recommends items based on user behavior and similarity

  -Supports both user-based and item-based recommendation techniques

  -Reads input data from a CSV file 

  -Calculates item similarity using algorithms like Log Likelihood or Tanimoto

  -Outputs top-N recommendations per user or item

  -Console-based application (easy to test and extend)

ðŸ§° Technologies Used :

  -Java (Core)

  -Apache Mahout (v0.9) â€“ for recommendation algorithms

  -Maven â€“ for dependency management

  -CSV File â€“ as the dataset source

  -SLF4J â€“ for logging support

ðŸ›  How It Works :

  -The system reads a dataset of user interactions from a CSV file.

  -It uses Apache Mahout's FileDataModel to load the data.

  -It computes similarity scores between users or items.

  -Based on the similarity, the recommender suggests the top-N items a user might like.

  -Recommendations are displayed on the console.

  âœ… Deliverable :
  
  -A fully functional Java application that:

  -Loads sample interaction data

  -Uses Apache Mahout to compute recommendations

  -Prints out relevant item suggestions for users
